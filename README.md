# Description:
This Python script is a basic monthly expense tracker.

# Features:
- Takes user input for the month they want to track expenses for.
- Validates the month input to ensure it's a valid month name.
- Takes user input for expenses in various categories; rent, groceries, utilities, etc.
- Validates the expense input to ensure only numbers used for the expenses
- Calculates and displays the total monthly expenses.

# Current Status:
The script currently handles input, validation, and calculation for a single month for four expense categories (rent, groceries, utilities, other). The functionality to gracefully exit the script is still under development.

# How to Use:
- Run the Python script.
- Follow the prompts to add, view, or remove tasks.
- Type "Exit" to end the program

Example:
- Run the script using a Python interpreter.
- Enter the month for which you want to calculate expenses.
- Enter the expenses associated with that month

# Notes:
- Month names are case-sensitive.
- The expenses are stored in memory and will be lost when the program exits.

# Future Enhancements:
- Accept dynamic input for multiple months and customized expenses; for example, the user may enter as many expense categories and the associated expense values
- Potentially store expense data in a file for future reference.
